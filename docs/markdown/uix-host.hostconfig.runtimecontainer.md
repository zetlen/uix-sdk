## HostConfig.runtimeContainer property

A DOM element \_outside\_ of the React root. This is necessary to preserve the lifetime of the iframes which are running extension objects; if they live inside the React root, then React could unexpectedly re-render the iframe tags themselves at any time, causing a reload of the frame.

**Signature:**

```typescript
runtimeContainer?: HTMLElement;
```
